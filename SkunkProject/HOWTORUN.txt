To Play Skunk Game
When a human player has an option to choose roll or not, the player could enter "y" to roll dice; otherwise, enter "n" to stop the turn.
The computer player will automatically decide roll or not.

AutoPlayApp.java (SkunkProject/src/skunk/ui/AutoPlayApp.java) is a pre-set game, it will automatically run 1000 Skunk Games, which has a random mode computer player VS a smart mode computer player.
The purpose of AutoPlayApp is to see if its strategy (based on the expected value) works or not.
